[feat] Export the authoring factories from `@astryxdesign/core`: `createConfig` at `@astryxdesign/core/config` and `createIntegration`/`createPageTemplate`/`createBlockTemplate`/`createComponentDoc`/`createFunctionDoc`/`createDoc` at `@astryxdesign/core/authoring`. Authoring a config or integration no longer requires depending on the CLI. Existing `@astryxdesign/cli/*` imports keep working via re-export.

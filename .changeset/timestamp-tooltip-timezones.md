[feat] Timestamp: new `tooltipEntries` prop renders the hover tooltip across several time zones and/or formats at once — one line per entry, each with an optional `timezoneID` (IANA id; omit it or pass `'local'` for the viewer's zone), `format` (every non-relative `TimestampFormat` plus `'full'`), and `label`. The default is unchanged: with no entries the tooltip stays the single full absolute line in the viewer's zone. Configuring entries also attaches the tooltip to absolute formats, which previously had none — note that this gives those timestamps a tab stop and focus ring, as relative timestamps already have, so a column of them gains one tab stop per row. `hasTooltip={false}` still suppresses the tooltip, and an empty array counts as no configuration. Also corrects `isTimezoneShown`'s documentation, which claimed it applied to the `system_date_time` and `system_time` formats; it never has, and those formats stay machine-readable. (#4188)

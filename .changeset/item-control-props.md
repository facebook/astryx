[feat] `Item` gains `controlProps`: attributes for the control the row renders for `onClick` or `href` (the invisible button or anchor the label sits in, where keyboard focus lands). A disclosure row's `aria-expanded`, `aria-haspopup` and `aria-controls`, a toggle's `aria-pressed`, a name of its own (`aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`), a host's `data-*` marks, `onKeyDown` and a composite's roving `tabIndex` reach the focused control instead of the root, where a screen reader does not read them. The row's own attributes win where they conflict (a disabled row keeps `tabIndex={-1}` and `aria-disabled` on its control); where the root is the link (`as`, with or without a `role`), they land on the root after the row's other props, the row's disabled state still winning, and never on an invisible button rendered beside that root; a row given no `controlProps` renders exactly what it did before; a row that renders no control (a `role` on a plain root, an `interactiveRef`, a link root included) ignores them with a development warning. `ListItem` passes the prop through unchanged. Type `ItemControlProps` is exported.

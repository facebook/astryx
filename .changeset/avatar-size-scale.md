[breaking] Avatar and AvatarGroup adopt Icon's abbreviated size scale — `size` now takes `xsm`/`sm`/`md`/`lg`/`xl` instead of `tiny`/`xsmall`/`small`/`medium`/`large`. Pixel values are unchanged (20/24/36/48/128px) and the default is now `md` (still 36px, formerly `small`). Avatar's tiers stay larger than Icon's because avatars align with media rather than glyphs. Run `astryx upgrade` to migrate call sites. (#2672)

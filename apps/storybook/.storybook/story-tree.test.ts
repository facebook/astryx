 *
 * Conventions that live only in a README drift: `Hooks/useClipboard` and
 * `Components/ChatComposer/Custom Input` both sat outside the pattern for
 * months because nothing but a reader could notice. This reads the built
 * index, so it judges what Storybook actually renders rather than what the
 * source appears to say.

 * Requires a built Storybook; skips itself when there is none, because a
 * fresh clone has no dist and this must not be the test that fails there.

/**
 * @file generate-score-ledger.mjs
 * @description Generates apps/sandbox/src/generated/componentScores.ts — the
 *   ROSTER of components (read from the ledger packages — core, lab and
 *   richtext — by the canonical predicate in scripts/score-ledger.mjs) plus a
 *   build-time SNAPSHOT of the audit ledger fetched from the wiki.
 * @input packages/{core,lab,richtext}/src, and the wiki ledger over the network.
 * @output src/generated/componentScores.ts
 * @position Sandbox build step, run by `pnpm generate`.
 *
 *   The two halves come from different places on purpose. The roster is the
 *   packages: a component added today shows up as TBD tomorrow with nobody
 *   maintaining a list. The scores are the wiki: an auditor records one with a
 *   wiki push and no pull request.
 *
 *   The snapshot exists only so the page is never blank, and so the page still
 *   works when the wiki is unreachable. The page re-fetches the same URL
 *   client-side at runtime, so a score recorded after this build shows up
 *   without a rebuild — and the page labels which of the two you are reading.
 *   If the fetch here fails — offline build, wiki down — the snapshot is null
 *   and the page relies on the live fetch alone; it never fails the build.
 *
 * SYNC: When the ledger schema changes, update scripts/score-ledger.mjs and the
 *   Component-Audit-Rubric wiki page too.

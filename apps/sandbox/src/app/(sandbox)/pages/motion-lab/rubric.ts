/**
 * @file rubric.ts
 * @input The project brief's rubric table, the published Motion page, the audit
 * @output The twelve criteria as data, plus how they are graded and enforced
 * @position Motion Lab data module; no React, no side effects
 *
 * The brief's Deliverables section promises "ten graded criteria" and its own
 * table lists twelve. Twelve is what is written here, because twelve is what
 * the table describes; the count in Deliverables is the thing to fix, and it
 * matters because a number in a deliverable gets quoted in a review.
 *
 * Two criteria contradict guidance Astryx publishes today rather than
 * extending it, so they carry a `guidance` marker: a rubric cannot fail a
 * component for following the docs. See publishedGuidance.ts.
 *
 * Evidence strings are built from the generated audit rather than typed, so a
 * regenerated audit moves the rubric's citations with it.

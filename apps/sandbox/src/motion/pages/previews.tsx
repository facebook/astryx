            The proposed pane uses <code>--ease-move</code> rather than the
            entry curve, because the indicator is already on screen: it needs a
            legible path, not an arrival accent. This is also the strongest
            candidate for the <code>layout</code> spring, since a travelling
            indicator is exactly the interruptible case.

            There is probably no single winner. A table row cannot be a grid
            container, so Table row expansion and Table tree cannot use the
            grid-track technique whatever the bake-off concludes. The realistic
            outcome is one default plus a documented exception — which is worth
            writing down as the decision, rather than discovering it halfway
            through the convergence work.

            The transform alternative — translate the rail and clip it — keeps
            the animation on the compositor but leaves the content beside it
            un-reflowed until the end, which reads worse than the layout cost.
            Worth prototyping both before granting the exception.

            FLIP — measure, move, invert, play — is the technique here because

            illegible at 1× means the duration is too short, not that the
            technique is wrong.

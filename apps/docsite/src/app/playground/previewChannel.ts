 * @file previewChannel.ts
 * @input Playground side: the preview iframe's window plus its `load` and the
 *   page's `message` events. Preview side: the document's own URL and the
 *   incoming `message` events.
 * @output A dedicated MessagePort pair that only the playground and a preview
 *   document the playground itself navigated to can hold.
 * @position Playground <-> preview iframe — the postMessage trust boundary.
 *
 * ## Why there is a boundary at all
 *
 * The preview iframe compiles and evaluates whatever source arrives on this
 * channel. It runs in a sandbox without `allow-same-origin`, so its document
 * has an opaque origin: no cookies, no storage, no reach into the parent
 * document — and no origin string that could identify either end. Origin
 * checks are therefore unavailable, and the trust anchor is a MessagePort
 * handshake instead: all traffic flows over a port pair, which no third window
 * can reach because ports are transferable capabilities, not broadcasts.
 *
 * ## Who is who
 *
 * - The PLAYGROUND (this site's origin) owns the iframe element and decides
 *   what URL it navigates to.
 * - The PREVIEW DOCUMENT is the site's own preview page, loaded at that URL.
 *   It is trusted code, but it hosts the previewed code with full authority
 *   over its own window: everything the document knows, previewed code knows,
 *   and previewed code can navigate the frame anywhere.
 * - A REPLACEMENT DOCUMENT is whatever the frame shows after previewed code
 *   navigated it (another origin, a data: URL, or a reload of the preview
 *   page itself). Only the playground can tell the two apart, and only by
 *   whether it navigated the frame there.
 *
 * ## The handshake
 *
 * 1. The playground navigates a FRESH iframe element to the preview URL with
 *    a random nonce in the fragment ({@link previewSrc}). The nonce exists
 *    only in the playground's memory and in that navigation's URL; a document
 *    already in the frame cannot read either (the iframe element lives in the
 *    parent's DOM, across the origin boundary).
 * 2. The preview document reads the nonce from its own URL and posts a hello
 *    carrying it to its parent window ({@link announcePreview}).
 * 3. The playground accepts a hello only from the current iframe's window,
 *    only while a nonce is outstanding, only when the nonce matches, and only
 *    once ({@link createPreviewConnector}). It answers by transferring one end
 *    of a fresh MessageChannel in a connect message; the preview adopts a port
 *    only from a connect sent by its own parent ({@link acceptPreviewConnect}),
 *    and `frame-ancestors 'self'` on the route pins who that parent can be.
 * 4. The preview document sends `preview-ready` over the port once its
 *    compiler is loaded AND its own document has finished loading. Nothing
 *    previewed runs before that, so the frame's first `load` event in a
 *    generation always belongs to the attested document.
 * 5. Every later `load` event means the attested document was replaced. The
 *    playground closes the port, discards the nonce (a hello replaying it is
 *    now worthless), and REMOUNTS the iframe with a new nonce. A new element
 *    is a new browsing context: the replacement document is destroyed along
 *    with any navigation it had in flight, so it cannot race the restore,
 *    and a same-path reload cannot degrade into a fragment navigation. Until
 *    the new element has mounted and handed over its window, the playground
 *    holds no frame window at all, so a hello landing in that gap — from the
 *    old frame, still alive until React commits — is rejected before the
 *    nonce is even compared.
 *
 * A replacement document can post any message it likes to the parent, but the
 * only message the playground acts on is a hello with the outstanding nonce,
 * which it never saw. Code, theme, and targeting commands travel only over the
 * port, and the port is only ever transferred to the window of a fresh frame
 * that just proved it loaded the URL the playground chose.

/**
 * @file playwright.config.ts
 * @input Uses @playwright/test; a production build of the docsite in .next
 * @output Chromium proofs for the docsite behaviors jsdom cannot observe.
 * @position Run from the repo root with `pnpm test:docsite-browser`, or from
 *   this directory with `pnpm exec playwright test`. Deliberately separate
 *   from `pnpm -F @astryxdesign/docsite test`: the Vitest suite must stay
 *   runnable from a cold clone with no browser and no build, and everything
 *   here needs both.
 *
 * The specs run against the PRODUCTION server. That is not a preference: the
 * playground preview only gets its opaque origin in production builds (see
 * PreviewStage.tsx), so the isolation these specs prove does not exist under
 * `next dev`. Build first:
 *
 *   pnpm -F @astryxdesign/docsite build
 *   pnpm exec playwright install chromium
 *   pnpm test:docsite-browser
 *
 * Outside CI an already-running `next start` on the port is reused, so a
 * server started by hand works too.
 *
 * SYNC: When the docsite gains another browser-only contract, add its spec
 * under e2e/.

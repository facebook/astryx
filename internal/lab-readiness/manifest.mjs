/**
 * @file manifest.mjs
 * @description Declares each lab graduation candidate and the readiness checks
 *   that cannot be proven from the repo — the ones that live in an RFC, a code
 *   review, or a person's judgement. Everything derivable from the source tree
 *   is computed in `automated.mjs` and overrides whatever is claimed here.
 * @input none — static data, hand-maintained alongside the RFC and PRs
 * @output CANDIDATES
 * @position Read by `audit.mjs`. This file is the honest boundary of the
 *   tooling: a claim here is a citation, not a proof.
 *
 * Declaring a check `passed` requires an `evidence` link a reviewer can open.
 * `audit.mjs` demotes any evidence-free `passed` claim to `in_progress`, so an
 * optimistic manifest cannot inflate the score.
 *
 * SYNC: When a tracking issue closes or a PR merges, update the state and the
 * evidence link here in the same change.

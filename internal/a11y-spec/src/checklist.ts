 * @file checklist.ts
 * @input None (pure declarations)
 * @output CHECKLIST_DIMENSIONS — the completeness review every pattern answers
 *   in full — and the disposition shape a pattern answers it with.
 * @position Consumed by ./contract.ts, which refuses a pattern that leaves a
 *   dimension unanswered.
 *
 * The rows are the source map in `docs/specs/AST-020/spec.md` FR10, plus the
 * component-owned outcomes that record tells an author to add on top of it:
 * forced colors, reduced motion, the adopted APG interaction set, and the
 * assistive-technology-facing strings the public Accessibility Checklist asks
 * for.
 *
 * A dimension is answered in exactly one of two ways (FR5):
 *
 * - encoded — one or more expectations name it in their `covers` list; or
 * - exempt  — this pattern does not own it, and the answer names who does and
 *             how it is actually verified.
 *
 * "Not applicable" on its own is not an answer, and neither is leaving a row
 * out. That is the failure mode the record is written against: a dimension that
 * disappears silently reads, later, exactly like one that was considered.
 *
 * SYNC: When a dimension is added here, every pattern contract must answer it —
 *   `definePattern` will fail until it does.

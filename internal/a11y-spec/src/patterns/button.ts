/**
 * @file button.ts
 * @input Uses ../contract (definePattern and the expectation vocabulary)
 * @output BUTTON_PATTERN — the adopted WAI-ARIA APG "button" pattern as a
 *   reusable contract — and ButtonStateFacts, what a binding declares each of
 *   its states is supposed to be.
 * @position The second authored pattern, modelled on ./switch.ts.
 *
 * Adopted pattern: https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/button/
 *
 * What this contract owns is the part of "is it a button" that is the same for
 * every component that adopts the pattern: the control is reported as a button
 * and not a link, it is named, its description reaches the user, a pointer runs
 * its action, BOTH Enter and Space run its action, a press slid off the control
 * is taken back, focus can reach it and leave it, and a button that cannot act
 * says so and stays inert.
 *
 * Two things the APG names are deliberately out of scope. A TOGGLE button
 * carries `aria-pressed` and has its own contract; this one covers the ordinary
 * command button. And an element that adopts LINK semantics — Astryx buttons
 * render an anchor when given `href` — is a link, so the APG's own note applies
 * ("the types of actions performed by buttons are distinctly different from the
 * function of a link") and the link pattern owns it.
 *
 * SYNC: When an expectation changes, update
 * - /internal/a11y-spec/README.md
 * - /packages/core/src/Button/__tests__/Button.a11y.test.tsx (the jsdom binding)
 * - /packages/core/src/Button/__tests__/Button.a11y.chromium.spec.ts (Chromium)

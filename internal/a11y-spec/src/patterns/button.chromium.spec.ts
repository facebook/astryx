/**
 * @file button.chromium.spec.ts
 * @input Uses @playwright/test, ./button (the contract), ./button.fixtures,
 *   ../harness/chromium, ../check
 * @output The contract's own proof in a real engine: every expectation passes
 *   against a conforming fixture and fails against each fixture that removes
 *   its outcome.
 * @position Self-test, the Chromium half of ./button.jsdom.test.ts. Both halves
 *   read the same fixtures, so the same positive and negative proof runs at
 *   every layer that can see it.
 *
 * The fixtures are hand-written HTML with no Astryx in them, because what is
 * under test here is the CONTRACT — whether an expectation can actually fail.
 * A component binding proves the different claim that the component delivers
 * the outcome.
 *
 * SYNC: Fixtures and mutations live in ./button.fixtures.ts, shared with the
 *   jsdom half.

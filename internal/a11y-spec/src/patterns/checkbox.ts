/**
 * @file checkbox.ts
 * @input Uses ../contract (definePattern and the expectation vocabulary)
 * @output CHECKBOX_PATTERN — the adopted WAI-ARIA APG "checkbox" pattern as a
 *   reusable contract — and CheckboxStateFacts, what a binding declares each of
 *   its states is supposed to be.
 * @position The third authored pattern, after switch and button.
 *
 * Adopted pattern: https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/checkbox/
 *
 * What this contract owns is the part of "is it a checkbox" that is the same for
 * every component that adopts the pattern: the checkbox-bearing role and name are
 * exposed, the unchecked, checked, or partially checked state matches what is
 * rendered, pointer activation changes it and can be taken back, direct checkboxes
 * respond to Space without trapping focus, and unavailable controls stay inert.
 * Menu arrow navigation and composite focus stay with the menu contract; callback,
 * form, composition, and styling behavior stays with each component
 * (`docs/specs/AST-021/spec.md` FR5).
 *
 * SYNC: When an expectation changes, update
 * - /internal/a11y-spec/README.md
 * - /packages/core/src/CheckboxInput/__tests__/Checkbox.a11y.test.tsx (the jsdom binding)
 * - /packages/core/src/CheckboxInput/__tests__/Checkbox.a11y.chromium.spec.ts (Chromium)

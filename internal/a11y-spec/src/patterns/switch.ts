/**
 * @file switch.ts
 * @input Uses ../contract (definePattern and the expectation vocabulary)
 * @output SWITCH_PATTERN — the adopted WAI-ARIA APG "switch" pattern as a
 *   reusable contract — and SwitchStateFacts, what a binding declares each of
 *   its states is supposed to be.
 * @position The first authored pattern. Every later pattern is modelled on it.
 *
 * Adopted pattern: https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/switch/
 *
 * What this contract owns is the part of "is it a switch" that is the same for
 * every component that adopts the pattern: the control is reported as a switch,
 * it is named, its on/off state is exposed and matches what is rendered, the
 * user can turn it on and back off with pointer and keyboard, focus can reach
 * it and leave it, and a switch that cannot be operated says so. Everything
 * that varies per component — callbacks, form participation, tooltip
 * composition, styling — stays with the component (`docs/specs/AST-021/spec.md`
 * FR5).
 *
 * SYNC: When an expectation changes, update
 * - /internal/a11y-spec/README.md
 * - /packages/core/src/Switch/__tests__/Switch.a11y.test.tsx (the jsdom binding)
 * - /packages/core/src/Switch/__tests__/Switch.a11y.chromium.spec.ts (the Chromium binding)

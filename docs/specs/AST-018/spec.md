# Approved palette authoring contract

## Intent

Give maintained themes a consistent, reviewable color reference without making
that reference part of the runtime theme contract.

A theme may keep an approved palette in a theme-owned source file. Authors and
tools can use it to select and audit explicit theme colors. `defineTheme()` still
receives the explicit values that control rendered output; it does not receive,
inherit, validate, publish, or resolve palette data.

Semantic tokens remain the primary interface for components and applications.
The palette is a starting point for color decisions and contrast testing, not a
claim that every component context already passes accessibility.

“Approved” means that the palette has been intentionally reviewed by its owning
theme. Structural validation does not grant design approval or certify contrast.

## Terminology

- A theme may own one **palette map**.
- The map contains named **families**, such as `neutral`, `red`, or `blue`.
- A family contains at least one mode-specific **ramp**: light, dark, or both.
- A ramp contains one or more author-defined numeric **stops**. Stop labels are
  finite JSON numbers in the inclusive range `0` through `100`; integer and
  decimal labels are valid, and equivalent spellings such as `5` and `5.0`
  identify the same stop. Different palettes may use different stop layouts to suit UI, iconography,
  illustration, data-visualization, or brand work.
- An **explicit theme color** is either a literal CSS color or an intentional
  reference to one exact value in the theme's committed palette file. In both
  cases, `defineTheme()` receives the resolved CSS value rather than palette
  metadata.
- An **alignment check** compares an intentionally palette-backed theme color to
  the approved palette stop from which it was selected.

```

The palette file remains available for later authoring and audits. It does not
disappear after suggestions are generated. Mapping suggestions are optional and
must never rewrite a theme automatically. The author reviews each selected color
and either stores its CSS value directly or references that exact value from the
committed palette file. Changing a referenced value is therefore a deliberate,
reviewable theme change.

## Non-goals

- Adding palettes to `DefineThemeInput` or `DefinedTheme`.
- Changing color expansion, inheritance, runtime CSS, or static theme builds.
- Requiring every theme to maintain a palette.
- Requiring every theme color to match a palette stop.
- Treating a stop as a semantic role or accessibility guarantee.
- Publishing palette files as runtime package artifacts in this change.
- Generating palettes or mapping suggestions in this change.
- Choosing the algorithm or production API for a future palette generator.

## Requirements

- **FR1 — Palette adoption is optional.** A maintained theme MAY keep a
  theme-owned palette file. A theme without one keeps its existing authoring,
  runtime, build, inheritance, and package behavior. Adopting a palette MUST NOT
  make it a required field of `defineTheme()`.
- **FR2 — The palette is authoring-only data.** Palette data MUST remain outside
  `DefineThemeInput`, `DefinedTheme`, runtime providers, generated CSS, and the
  generic `astryx theme build` output. It MAY be colocated with its theme or
  imported from another authoring source. This contract does not require one
  repository layout, but each maintained palette MUST have a clear owner. A
  theme-owned palette MUST remain private to that theme unless a separate public
  API explicitly accepts compatibility obligations for its family and stop keys.
- **FR3 — Declared ramps use an explicit, author-defined shape.** A palette map
  MUST contain at least one named family. Each family MUST declare a non-empty
  light ramp, a non-empty dark ramp, or both. Missing modes MUST NOT be inferred.
  A theme such as Gothic MAY declare only dark ramps, while a theme such as Stone
  MAY maintain only one family. A shared ramp MUST be assigned to both modes
  explicitly. Each ramp defines its own strictly increasing stop labels and
  opaque six-digit hex values. Labels MUST be finite JSON numbers from `0`
  through `100`, unique after numeric normalization, and strictly increasing.
  Endpoints `0` and `100` are optional, and a one-stop ramp is valid. This
  contract MUST NOT require 11, 21, or any other fixed stop count. A generator
  MAY recommend a default layout without making that layout a validity rule.
  Optional hue, chroma, purpose, and description fields are metadata only.
- **FR4 — Validation is explicit and non-mutating.** A palette checker MUST
  inspect declared data without defining, normalizing, generating, or returning
  a replacement palette. It MUST report all structural problems with stable
  paths and messages. Structural errors include an empty palette, an empty ramp,
  duplicate or invalid stop labels (including non-finite values, values outside
  `0..100`, non-unique numeric values such as `5` and `5.0`, or labels that are
  not strictly increasing), malformed colors, and invalid mode shapes.
  A checker MUST validate the stop layout the author declared rather than require
  a universal stop inventory. It MUST NOT run from `defineTheme()`, a runtime
  provider, or the generic theme build. A public checker or CLI requires its own
  accepted API contract.
- **FR5 — Theme choices remain explicit.** Authors and tools MAY use a palette to
  suggest or choose a color. A theme mapping MAY store the accepted CSS color
  literally or intentionally reference that exact value from its committed
  palette file. A reference MUST resolve to a supported CSS value before runtime
  output and MUST NOT make `defineTheme()` aware of palette families or stops.
  Renaming or removing a referenced stop MUST fail type checking, validation, or
  the theme build. Changing a referenced value is an intentional theme change
  and MUST be reviewed with its rendered impact.
- **FR6 — Validation and alignment are separate checks.** An adopting theme MUST
  test that its palette has no structural errors. It SHOULD separately test the
  theme mappings intentionally selected from palette stops. The alignment test
  MUST NOT imply that every direct theme color is a violation. Alpha overlays,
  brand colors, composited colors, and contrast-specific adjustments MAY remain
  explicit intentional deviations.
- **FR7 — Accessibility remains contextual.** A structurally valid palette or an
  aligned mapping does not prove that a foreground/background pair, interaction
  state, or component passes WCAG. The owning theme MUST test contrast in the
  actual component contexts it intends to support.
- **FR8 — Generation is a separate capability.** A future generator or CLI MAY
  create candidate palette files or mapping suggestions. That work MUST have its
  own accepted contract and review. Generated output remains a candidate until a
  theme author reviews and adopts it; merely adding a palette MUST NOT trigger
  automatic nearest-color replacement.

## Handling existing and intentional differences

This contract applies only when a theme chooses to adopt the palette shape. It
does not retroactively reject unrelated themes or their existing color systems.

The validator distinguishes the declared contract from theme usage:

- Invalid palette containers, malformed colors, duplicate or invalid stop labels,
  empty ramps, or a family with neither mode are structural errors.
- Light-only, dark-only, dual-mode, single-family, and multi-family palettes are
  supported shapes rather than exceptions.
- Colors outside the palette are not validator errors because the validator does
  not inspect theme tokens or components.
- When a palette includes a neutral family, authors SHOULD use it for near-black,
  near-white, and other achromatic UI roles. Exact black and white remain
  ordinary explicit theme values rather than required family endpoints. This is
  authoring guidance rather than a structural validation rule.
- An intentional mapping difference is handled in the owning theme's alignment
  test: update the theme, retain and document the explicit deviation, or revert
  the palette change.

Future repository tooling may add warnings after maintained palettes are audited
for real patterns. It must not convert an intentional existing pattern into a
hard failure without first adding that pattern to the contract or documenting a
narrow exception.

## Current-state impact

Current `main` stores explicit theme colors and has no palette field in the
normalized theme contract. This proposal preserves that behavior.

Neutral is the intended first adopter in a separate follow-up. Its palette can
live in a private theme-owned TypeScript file, while `neutralTheme.ts` explicitly
references reviewed values that resolve to CSS colors. That adoption requires its own
visual review, tests, theme record, and release treatment rather than receiving
implicit approval from this contract.

The existing sandbox generator remains useful design evidence. A production
generator is intentionally deferred to a separate proposal informed by the
sandbox and the discussion in PR #5800.

## Verification

This specification-only change runs the repository knowledge checks and changes
no package, runtime, build, theme, or public API behavior. Follow-up
implementations must prove that palette authoring remains outside the runtime
theme contract and test only the palette shapes they explicitly support.

## Decision log

### DEC-1 — Palettes guide consistency without enforcing it

**Reference:** `spec:AST-018/DEC-1`

**Decider:** `rubyycheung`, `2026-09-02`

Themes may use a palette to establish consistent color expression, but adoption
and usage remain optional. Semantic tokens are preferred, while intentional
direct colors remain valid.

Rejected: requiring every theme or every color to use the palette. That would
turn authoring guidance into runtime policy and misrepresent legitimate
overlays, brand colors, and contrast-specific values.

### DEC-2 — Palette data stays outside the runtime theme contract

**Reference:** `spec:AST-018/DEC-2`

**Decider:** `rubyycheung`, `2026-09-03`

Palette files are theme-owned authoring references. `defineTheme()` does not
accept, validate, retain, inherit, or publish them. This follows
`architecture:theme-authoring-contract`: validation-only data does not enter the
normalized runtime theme.

Rejected: a `palettes` field on `DefineThemeInput` or `DefinedTheme`. It adds
runtime compatibility cost without constructing a runtime value.

### DEC-3 — Validation reports; it does not define or prescribe a stop count

**Reference:** `spec:AST-018/DEC-3`

**Decider:** `rubyycheung`, `2026-09-03`

Palette validation reports structural errors without returning the unchanged
palette as though it constructed a new value. It validates the author's declared
stop layout rather than prescribing 11 or 21 stops. Theme-package tests or an
accepted future CLI decide how validation results affect CI.

Rejected: a Core `defineTonalPalettes()` or `validateTonalPalettes()` export.
Under `spec:AST-002/FR17` and DEC-7, a `define*` helper must construct or
normalize a durable supported value, while validation-only authoring data does
not belong in the Core runtime contract.

### DEC-4 — Theme mappings explicitly select reviewed CSS values

**Reference:** `spec:AST-018/DEC-4`

**Decider:** `rubyycheung`, `2026-09-03`

Palette-based mappings are authoring decisions. Once approved, the theme may
store the selected CSS value literally or intentionally reference that exact
value from its private committed palette file. The latter makes the palette the
single source of truth: changing it is a visible theme-affecting source change,
and missing references fail instead of falling back. Neither form adds palette
semantics to `defineTheme()` or runtime output.

Rejected: rerunning generation during ordinary theme builds and automatic
nearest-color replacement. Either could change rendered colors without a
reviewed edit to the committed palette or theme source.

### DEC-5 — Neutral's remap is a contrast-testing baseline

**Reference:** `spec:AST-018/DEC-5`

**Decider:** `rubyycheung`, `2026-09-02`

Neutral's approved palette and explicit remap provide an anchor for future color
decisions and component contrast tests. Approval does not claim that every
existing component, mode, or interaction state already passes accessibility.

Rejected: making complete component-level conformance a prerequisite for the
palette. The palette is the baseline used to find and fix those contextual
issues.

### DEC-6 — Supported modes are explicit

**Reference:** `spec:AST-018/DEC-6`

**Decider:** `rubyycheung`, `2026-09-03`

A family declares light, dark, or both ramps. Missing modes are not inferred.
This supports dark-only themes such as Gothic and single-family themes such as
Stone without pretending they have a different mode or inventory.

### DEC-7 — Palette generation is follow-up work

**Reference:** `spec:AST-018/DEC-7`

**Decider:** `rubyycheung`, `2026-09-03`

This proposal validates adopted palette files. A production generator and any
CLI commands for creation or mapping suggestions require a separate proposal.
The existing sandbox prototype and PR #5800 are inputs to that future design,
not runtime dependencies or accepted APIs in this contract.

### DEC-8 — Stop layouts belong to palette authors

**Reference:** `spec:AST-018/DEC-8`

**Decider:** `rubyycheung`, `2026-09-03`

The contract accepts any non-empty author-defined stop layout whose finite
numeric labels are unique, strictly increasing, and within `0..100`. A future
Astryx generator may default to 21 stops for finer authoring choices, but an
11-stop, one-stop, or specialized palette for icons, illustrations,
visualization, or brand work is equally valid. Tools with narrower input
requirements must state and validate those requirements locally rather than
redefining palette validity.

Rejected: requiring every palette to contain both endpoints or a fixed increment
such as five. That would turn one generator default into an unnecessary
restriction on unrelated authoring needs.

## Open questions

None.

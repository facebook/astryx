\`astryx\` below means the project's installed CLI invocation, such as its local binary or existing package script. If none is installed, report that evidence gap instead of downloading a different version.

Before evaluating:
1. Read \`astryx docs is-my-code-good --full\`.
2. Read the root and relevant nested \`AGENTS.md\` files plus other project guidance. State what the app is for, who uses it, and the task this surface supports.
3. Trace the surface's route, entry point, navigation path, parent shell, and expected page or block pattern.
4. Inspect at least two sibling surfaces that do the same or adjacent jobs. Record their shared headers, actions, layout, spacing, density, states, and narrow-screen behavior.
5. Record the app's theme, density, app-owned wrappers, and documented intentional conventions.
6. Read the project manifest and lockfile for the installed Astryx, CLI, and integration versions. Run \`astryx component --list\`, then identify relevant integration components and app-owned wrappers.
7. List the real data states, roles and permissions, supported locales and RTL behavior, and mobile or narrow-width needs.
8. Inspect every source file in scope and its public imports.
9. Run \`astryx component <Name> --dense\` for each Astryx component whose replacement, prop, or composition you question.
10. Read \`astryx docs spacing --full\` and the target component's docs before mapping a literal spacing value to a prop or token.
11. Render every supplied state at narrow and wide widths and in each supported color mode.
12. Read the build, type-check, test, and accessibility-check results.

If only source is supplied, continue with a source check. Report blockers visible in the source, list every missing app-context and product-evidence item, and do not call the full product good. Do not leave the blocker list empty only because no checks were supplied.

Judge the code against the app as well as Astryx. Ask whether it matches sibling surfaces, uses the right shell and page pattern, reuses app or integration components instead of rebuilding them, preserves intentional app conventions, and lets the target user complete the task.

For each rubric category, return \`good\`, \`needs work\`, or \`not inspected\`. Every context-dependent finding must cite the route, sibling file, project guidance, theme, component catalog, wrapper, or user requirement it relies on. Cite file and line evidence for source findings and name the rendered state for visual findings. Mark context you could not learn as \`not inspected\`. Do not flag a documented intentional app convention merely because it differs from a generic pattern. Never turn missing evidence into a pass. Do not hide raw HTML or custom styles behind a helper. Do not calculate a template score for ordinary product code.

Return:
- app purpose, target users, surface job, route, and entry path
- app context inspected and app context missing
- product evidence inspected and product evidence missing
- one row per rubric category with result, evidence, and fix
- task-completion, functional, or accessibility blockers visible in the source or found by the supplied checks
- the top three fixes in order
- every claim that still needs a person to verify`,

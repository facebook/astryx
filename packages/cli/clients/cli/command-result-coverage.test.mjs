/**
 * @file Every command that runs reports what it answered with.
 *
 * The contract is enforced twice, on purpose, because it has two holes and they
 * are different shapes:
 *
 *   1. A command registered through `defineCommand` cannot forget: its action's
 *      RETURN TYPE is `CommandResult`, so a missing or wrong descriptor is a
 *      typecheck failure before the code ever runs. That is the real gate.
 *   2. A command registered by hand — `program.command(...).action(...)` —
 *      bypasses the converter and therefore bypasses the type. Nothing about
 *      such a command looks wrong; it simply reports nothing, forever, and the
 *      only symptom is a column of nulls in somebody's query months later.
 *
 * This file is the second gate. It walks the ASSEMBLED program — the same one
 * the binary runs — and requires every command that can execute to be on the
 * reporting path. A new command fails here until someone makes a deliberate
 * choice about what it answers with.
 *
 * @input the assembled Commander program
 * @output a failure naming any command that would run unreported
 * @position packages/cli/clients/cli — command coverage

 * that is a real change to what the CLI does and it should be read, not
 * absorbed. (`theme` is deliberately NOT here: it HAS an action — the one that

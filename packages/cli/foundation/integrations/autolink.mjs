/**
 * @file Autolink — load installed integrations that no astryx.config names.
 *
 * An integration used to need two things to be visible: the package installed,
 * and its name written into `astryx.config.*`. In practice the second half goes
 * missing. A scaffold adds the dependency and writes no config; the package
 * ships components, templates, docs and codemods; and the CLI reports that none
 * of it exists. Nothing is broken, so nobody looks — the integration is simply
 * never used, because we said it was not there.
 *
 * Autolink closes that gap from the side that is always true: a package the
 * project DECLARED as a dependency and that ships a root
 * `astryx.integration.*` manifest is an integration, config entry or not.
 *
 * Two rules bound it:
 *
 *   - DECLARED dependencies only. We read the dependency KEYS out of the
 *     project's own package.json and resolve those. We never walk node_modules
 *     looking for manifests: a transitive dependency of a dependency did not
 *     ask to contribute to this project, and a tree walk is unbounded work for
 *     an answer the project already wrote down.
 *   - The KEY, never the VALUE. `"@acme/legacy-ui": "npm:@acme/ui@0.1.22"`
 *     is a real, installed shape; so are `workspace:*`, `file:../lib`, `link:`
 *     and `catalog:`. None of them is a semver range, and none of them has to
 *     be parsed: the key is the directory name under node_modules, which is the
 *     only thing resolution needs. Identity still comes from the resolved
 *     package's own package.json `name` (see loadIntegrations), so an aliased
 *     dependency reports the package it actually is.
 *
 * An explicit config entry always wins: a dependency whose directory is
 * already loaded from config is never imported again, and comes back as a
 * repeat so the provider ledger still records it.
 *
 * @position lib — sits between config/project (the caller) and
 *   integrations/integrations (the loader); contributes no discovery of its own.

/**
 * Component usage documentation — a concise summary, design guidance
 * best practices, and optional visual anatomy.
 *
 * ## description
 * Exactly 2-3 short sentences:
 * - Sentence 1: What the component is and does.
 * - Sentence 2-3: When to use it, or what context it belongs in.
 *
 * Reference tone: "Buttons provide visual cues for actions and events.
 * These fundamental components allow users to commit actions and navigate
 * a page flow. Use a Button when a user needs to submit a form, start a
 * new task or action, or trigger a new UI element to appear on the page."
 *
 * ## bestPractices
 * Array of 3-4 items. Usually 2 Do items, then 1-2 Don't items.
 * Each item is design guidance — not implementation details.
 * Never start the description with "Do" or "Don't".

 * because that is the shape of the entries this helper generates, and a `*` key
 * claims by pattern, using the same matcher `withoutCallerOverrides` applies.
 *
 * Where a caller points its alias is its business; the only thing worth saying
 * is that nothing routes the packages at all, which is the pre-0.5.3 config. A
 * false positive here tells someone their working build is broken, while a false
 * negative merely stays quiet — so this errs toward silence.

/**
 * @file Switch.a11y.chromium.spec.ts
 * @input Uses @playwright/test, @astryxdesign/a11y-spec (the switch contract,
 *   the Chromium harness, the runner, the Storybook server) and the checked-in
 *   Switch stories
 * @output The Chromium lane of Switch's binding to the shared switch pattern:
 *   the computed accessibility tree, real focus, and real activation.
 * @position The lane that carries most of this contract. jsdom cannot compute a
 *   role or a name, cannot resolve a tab sequence, and cannot turn a key press
 *   into an activation, so those outcomes are proven here or not at all.
 *
 * Run it with:
 *   pnpm storybook:build && npx playwright install chromium
 *   pnpm test:a11y-contract
 *
 * SYNC: States live in ./Switch.a11y.states.ts, known failures in
 *   ./Switch.a11y.known-failures.ts, both shared with the jsdom lane.

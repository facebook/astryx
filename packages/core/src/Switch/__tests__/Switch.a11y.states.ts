 * A state earns a row when it can change what the switch pattern promises: a
 * different exposed state, a different operability, a different name source, a
 * different attached description. States that change only appearance — size,
 * label position, label spacing, width, theme — cannot, so they stay in
 * Switch.test.tsx where the component owns them.

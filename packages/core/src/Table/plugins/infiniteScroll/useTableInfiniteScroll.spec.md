# useTableInfiniteScroll module contract

## Contract at a glance

| Area                    | Contract                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Public contract         | Candidate `useTableInfiniteScroll` hook returning one `TablePlugin` from controlled `hasMore`, controlled `isLoading`, and `onLoadMore`; root, reset, fallback, and look-ahead inputs remain unadmitted until their owner decisions pass.                                            |
| Behavior                | One end sentinel requests the next batch as it approaches the relevant block-scroll viewport, never overlaps requests, and rearms when loading completes while more data remains.                                                                                                    |
| End-user impact         | People can continue through incrementally loaded rows without duplicate requests, focus disruption, inaccessible progress, or a dead end when automatic observation is unavailable.                                                                                                  |
| Builder impact          | Builders own data, request state, errors, and appended rows. The plugin owns observation, duplicate suppression, progress/fallback presentation, and cleanup.                                                                                                                        |
| Compatibility/readiness | Additive, unreleased module. This draft is not implementation authority. Scroll-root ownership, request completion/reset, parent rendering-mode seam, fallback policy, loading/error composition, customization, and announcement evidence require owner decisions before promotion. |
| Review checks           | Reject viewport assumptions, overlapping loads, stale callbacks, a permanently visible sentinel loop, unexplained focusable sentinels, progress announced on every observer tick, a mouse-only fallback, invalid table DOM, retained observers, or router/data-client dependencies.  |
| Governing rules         | `component:Table` FR9-FR12 and ORD1-ORD4 own plugin composition; `architecture:react-component-runtime` owns observer lifetime; `architecture:public-component-api` and `spec:AST-002` own public caller burden.                                                                     |

This table is a review projection; the body below is authoritative.

## Intent

`useTableInfiniteScroll` connects incremental data loading to a data-driven Table
without making Table own a router, cache, query client, cursor format, or product data.
It owns an end sentinel, observation lifecycle, one-request-at-a-time behavior,
rearming, accessible progress, and a keyboard-operable fallback.

Infinite scroll is distinct from client pagination and virtualization. It appends data;
it does not choose the caller's page/cursor protocol or bound the number of rendered rows.

## Compatibility and migration

- Released default preserved: `yes`; Table behavior remains unchanged unless the new plugin is supplied.
- Compatibility class: additive public hook, types, documentation, and examples.
- Migration decision: `module:Table/useTableInfiniteScroll/DEC-1` after the open ownership decisions are approved.

Consumer migration instructions belong in consumer docs and release notes.

## Ownership boundary

**Owns**

- The public hook, configuration, sentinel, observer lifecycle, and loading trigger boundary.
- Duplicate-request suppression, rearming after completion, and short-batch behavior.
- Default progress and manual fallback behavior, accessibility, performance, and evidence.
- Composition with Table's scroll wrapper, empty state, loading state, appended rows, other plugins, and an enforceable children-mode warning/no-op.

**Does not own / non-goals**

- Aggregate `TablePlugin` protocol, transform order, or scroll-wrapper implementation — owned by `component:Table`.
- Product data, request/cursor/page state, cache policy, retry policy, or error content — owned by the caller or another module.
- Client pagination, server pagination, Relay integration, row virtualization, or column virtualization.
- Scroll restoration, URL state, routing, or prefetching.
- A new public Table theme target unless a later proposal proves a distinct theme-author need.
- Caller-composed children-mode semantics. The plugin only detects that mode through the parent-owned signal, then no-ops and warns; it never interprets or appends loading UI to caller children.

## Public API and concepts

The candidate minimum shape is:

```ts
export interface UseTableInfiniteScrollConfig {
  hasMore: boolean;
  isLoading: boolean;
  onLoadMore: () => void | Promise<void>;
}

export function useTableInfiniteScroll<T extends Record<string, unknown>>(
  config: UseTableInfiniteScrollConfig,
): TablePlugin<T>;
```

The final shape is blocked on OQ1-OQ8. Consumer docs own final signatures,
defaults, imports, and examples after promotion.

| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| FR1  | Stable configuration callbacks and unchanged primitive inputs preserve one stable `TablePlugin`.                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Parent plugin identity and runtime architecture | Settled candidate                      |
| FR2  | The plugin contributes one end sentinel after the semantic `<table>`, inside the Table scroll-wrapper content. It never inserts non-row content inside `<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, or `<tr>`.                                                                                                 | Valid HTML and parent wrapper contract          | Settled candidate                      |
| FR3  | Automatic loading is armed only when `hasMore` is true and `isLoading` is false. One visibility episode produces at most one active request.                                                                                                                                                       | Duplicate suppression                           | Settled candidate                      |
| FR4  | While a request is active, observation cannot start another. Completion rearms only the current plugin request generation; settlement from an older callback/configuration cannot release or rearm a newer lock. The caller remains solely responsible for suppressing stale product-data commits. | Controlled state and async ownership            | Callback completion contract unsettled |
| FR5  | When a short append leaves the sentinel visible and `hasMore` remains true, completing the prior load can request the next batch without requiring the user to scroll away and back.                                                                                                               | Continuous loading behavior                     | Settled outcome; mechanism free        |
| FR6  | `hasMore=false` disconnects observation, removes the manual command, and presents no loading state. Changing back to true can arm a new request.                                                                                                                                                   | Exhausted-state boundary                        | Settled candidate                      |
| FR7  | An observer-unavailable environment preserves server rendering/hydration and exposes the approved manual fallback rather than throwing or silently dead-ending the user.                                                                                                                           | Progressive enhancement                         | Fallback policy unsettled              |
| FR8  | Loading progress is shown and announced at most once per state transition, not once per observer callback. Error and retry UI remain caller-owned and do not render duplicate progress chrome.                                                                                                     | Accessibility and module boundary               | Composition surface unsettled          |
| FR9  | The module does not call another plugin's callbacks, mutate selection/activation/expansion/sort/filter state, replace product rows, or reset scroll position. Preservation of caller-controlled state follows from that non-interference; caller data updates remain caller-owned.                 | Plugin independence                             | Settled candidate                      |
| FR10 | Empty data may still load when `hasMore=true`; default EmptyState and load affordance do not obscure each other or communicate contradictory states.                                                                                                                                               | Empty/loading composition                       | Human layout decision                  |
| FR11 | Approved scroll-root or look-ahead changes reconnect observation without leaking the old observer or triggering from a detached sentinel. Unmount and node replacement release every observer and retained node.                                                                                   | `architecture:react-component-runtime`          | Settled candidate                      |
| FR12 | The plugin remains data-protocol agnostic. `onLoadMore` receives no Table-owned page, cursor, Relay, router, cache, or request-client object.                                                                                                                                                      | Public ownership boundary                       | Settled candidate                      |
| FR13 | In children mode the module is a no-op and emits at most one deduplicated development warning. The parent exposes rendering mode to the wrapper transform so this invalid combination is enforceable rather than inferred from DOM.                                                                | Parent rendering-mode ownership                 | Parent API decision required           |
| FR14 | Reconfiguration while a request is active follows one approved reset-generation or remount boundary. Settlement from an older generation cannot unlock, rearm, or change presentation for the current generation; caller response ownership remains unchanged.                                     | Async generation ownership                      | Human API decision                     |

### Transformation and precedence order

- **ORD1 — Exhausted/loading gate.** Resolve `hasMore` and `isLoading` before observing or exposing a manual command.
- **ORD2 — Current generation.** Resolve the approved reset/remount identity and current `onLoadMore` before acquiring a request lock; callback identity alone does not silently redefine product-data ownership.
- **ORD3 — Request lock.** Acquire the one-request gate before invoking caller code; synchronous throws and async settlement follow one explicit release rule.
- **ORD4 — Settlement ownership.** Only settlement belonging to the current plugin generation may release or rearm its lock; the plugin never commits or rejects caller data.
- **ORD5 — Rearm.** Controlled completion and continued `hasMore` rearm the current sentinel, including when it remains visible.
- **ORD6 — Presentation.** Exhausted, loading, automatic, fallback, and error-adjacent states render one coherent after-table surface.
- **ORD7 — Parent pipeline.** In data mode the module appends to accumulated `afterTable` content and preserves prior wrapper props, styles, refs, and chrome; children mode returns prior props unchanged.

### Performance and resources

- **PR1 — One observer.** At most one `IntersectionObserver` and one observed sentinel exist per mounted plugin instance.
- **PR2 — No scroll listener.** Native observation, not a per-frame or per-scroll JavaScript listener, drives automatic loading.
- **PR3 — Stable resources.** Callback updates do not recreate observation when the approved root/look-ahead geometry and sentinel are unchanged.
- **PR4 — Complete cleanup.** Unmount, sentinel replacement, root replacement, exhaustion, and loading transitions release obsolete observation.
- **PR5 — Constant callback work.** An observer entry performs constant coordination work and never scans rows or columns.

## Accessibility contract

- **AR1 — Valid structure.** Sentinel, progress, and fallback UI stay outside the semantic table and do not appear as data rows or cells (WCAG 2.2 SC 1.3.1; DOM/accessibility-tree and browser evidence).
- **AR2 — Progress announcement.** Loading transitions use a non-interruptive status that does not repeat for observer churn or every appended row (WCAG 2.2 SC 4.1.3). Deterministic transition tests prove event count/order, and the approved implementation requires NVDA + Chrome on Windows and VoiceOver + Safari on macOS to prove spoken announcement timing under `spec:AST-009` FR4 and FR12.
- **AR3 — Operable fallback.** The approved fallback is a real keyboard-operable control with a localized name and visible focus; the sentinel itself is not an unexplained tab stop (WCAG 2.2 SC 2.1.1, 2.4.7, and 4.1.2; DOM/axe/real-browser evidence).
- **AR4 — Focus stability.** Appending rows does not move focus, reset focused descendants, or make the fallback disappear while it owns focus without a deterministic successor (WCAG 2.2 SC 2.4.3 and 2.4.7; real-browser keyboard evidence).
- **AR5 — Reduced motion.** Progress presentation does not require motion to communicate loading state and respects platform motion settings; real-browser visual evidence proves the supported states.
- **AR6 — Touch and zoom.** Automatic loading and fallback remain available without hover, precision pointing, or a fixed viewport size (WCAG 2.2 SC 1.4.10 and 2.1.1; responsive/touch real-browser evidence).
- **AR7 — Evidence boundaries.** Real AT evidence is limited to AR2's announcement claim or any later approved AT-dependent outcome; it supplements rather than replaces deterministic state, DOM, keyboard, and browser coverage.

## Design relationships

| Anatomy or state    | Design requirement                                                                    | Representation authority  | Module contract   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------- |
| End sentinel        | Supplies observation geometry without masquerading as table data or a control.        | This module               | FR2-FR7, AR1      |
| Loading progress    | Communicates one active append operation without duplicating caller-owned chrome.     | Unsettled pending OQ4     | FR3-FR8, AR2, AR5 |
| Manual load command | Provides an explicit fallback with normal control semantics and focus treatment.      | Unsettled pending OQ3/OQ4 | FR7-FR10, AR3-AR4 |
| Exhausted state     | Stops requesting and removes load affordances without adding an unsolicited message.  | This module               | FR6, ORD1, ORD5   |
| Error/retry         | Remains outside the module unless a later loading/error composition contract owns it. | Caller or another module  | FR8, non-goal     |

No direct theme target is proposed. OQ3/OQ4 must select any progress/fallback component and then name its exact existing target or record a classified `none`; no delegation is promised yet. Sentinel geometry is implementation detail rather than theme API.

## Parent and system relationships

- `component:Table` owns the scroll-wrapper phase, accumulated `afterTable` slot, and rendering-mode knowledge. This module requires an approved data/children mode signal at that phase so children mode can be an enforceable warning/no-op.
- `architecture:react-component-runtime` owns observer acquisition, current-value synchronization, node replacement, StrictMode replay, and cleanup boundaries.
- `architecture:public-component-api` and `spec:AST-002` require a protocol-agnostic API whose inputs express caller-owned state rather than implementation clients.
- `spec:AST-009` and `spec:AST-020` own announcement evidence and the WCAG/evidence-layer boundary; AR2 is the only current real-AT-dependent claim.
- Pagination and virtualization remain separate modules. Infinite loading can compose with them only where their current contracts explicitly permit it.

## Decision log

### DEC-1 — Infinite scroll owns loading coordination, not data

**Reference:** `module:Table/useTableInfiniteScroll/DEC-1`
**Decider:** pending owner approval

The module observes the end of rendered Table content and asks the caller for another batch. It owns only its request lock, generation, rearm, and presentation. The caller remains the sole owner of rows, request protocol, cache, cursor/page, stale-response suppression, errors, and retry policy.

Rejected: importing a router/query client, mutating Table data, or combining cursor,
server-pagination, Relay, and infinite-loading contracts.

### DEC-2 — The sentinel is after the table

**Reference:** `module:Table/useTableInfiniteScroll/DEC-2`
**Decider:** pending owner approval

Observation and progress UI use the parent scroll wrapper's `afterTable` slot. They never
insert non-row elements into semantic table structure or synthesize a fake data row.

Rejected: a `<div>` inside `<tbody>`, a sentinel `<tr>` announced as data, and a focusable
sentinel with no user command.

### DEC-3 — Automatic loading requires an operable fallback

**Reference:** `module:Table/useTableInfiniteScroll/DEC-3`
**Decider:** pending owner approval

Automatic observation is progressive enhancement. An approved fallback prevents a dead
end when observation is unsupported, disabled, or unsuitable and gives keyboard users an
explicit command without making the sentinel itself interactive.

Rejected: silently doing nothing without IntersectionObserver and making automatic loading
the only path.

## Open questions

- **OQ1 — Who owns the block-scroll root?** (`human-api`) Decide viewport default versus an explicit caller root/ref, and how Table nested in a vertical `ScrollableArea` identifies the correct root without brittle ancestor discovery.
- **OQ2 — What completes the request lock?** (`human-api`) Decide whether controlled `isLoading`, a returned promise, or both release duplicate suppression after synchronous throw and async settlement.
- **OQ3 — When is manual fallback shown?** (`human-design`) Decide always-visible, observer-unavailable-only, user-selected, or another policy; define focus behavior when loading/exhaustion removes it.
- **OQ4 — What loading customization is public?** (`human-api`) Decide whether the module renders one fixed default, accepts `renderLoadingIndicator`, composes an existing loading-state module, or stays behavior-only while still meeting progress requirements.
- **OQ5 — How do error and retry compose?** (`human-api`) Keep error content caller-owned, but define how a failed request rearms automatic loading and avoids immediate retry loops or duplicate loading/error chrome.
- **OQ6 — Is caller-configurable look-ahead admitted?** (`human-api`) First prove a non-derivable caller distinction under `spec:AST-002`; if admitted, choose an intent-named distance API with explicit units/default rather than reusing browser `threshold` terminology, which conventionally means an intersection ratio. Keep it out of the candidate interface until then.
- **OQ7 — What resets plugin request generation?** (`human-api`) Decide an explicit caller-owned reset identity versus a documented React remount/key boundary when dataset/query configuration changes during a load. Stale settlement may not release/rearm the new generation, while stale product-data suppression remains the caller's job.
- **OQ8 — How does the parent expose data versus children mode?** (`human-api`) Add an enforceable parent-owned rendering-mode signal to the wrapper transform (or make the invalid combination unrepresentable) so children mode is a no-op with one development warning rather than a sentinel appended to caller composition.

## Content boundary

This record does not duplicate consumer signatures/examples, the parent Table wrapper
protocol, general observer mechanics, current usage audits, implementation steps, or
pagination/virtualization/data-client contracts. It links to their canonical owners.

    'Headless tree plugin for Table: renders nested rows with per-level indentation and expand/collapse chevrons in the tree column (the first column by default). When any row is expandable the table is a WAI-ARIA treegrid: role="treegrid" on the table, and every body row carries aria-level, aria-expanded (parents only), aria-posinset and aria-setsize. Keyboard, with row focus: the visible rows share one roving tab stop; ArrowUp/ArrowDown move between rows, ArrowRight expands a collapsed row or moves into its first child, ArrowLeft collapses an expanded row or moves to the parent, Home/End jump to the first/last row, and Enter/Space toggle an expandable row. Controls inside cells (the chevron, a selection checkbox, a sort header) stay in the Tab order and keep their own keys. This first version is row focus only: cell-by-cell navigation is not implemented, and a composition that needs it (editable cells, per-cell actions reached by arrow keys) is outside the supported contract. Composable with the other Table plugins: the canonical plugin order places tree before selection, so the checkbox column lands left of the indented tree column. Feed it the treeConfig from useTableTreeState, or construct the config directly for server-driven or pre-flattened trees. When no row is expandable (flat data), every transform is a pass-through and the table renders identically to one without the plugin. Known limitation: the tree column wraps its cell content, so textOverflow="truncate" tooltips do not apply within the tree column.',

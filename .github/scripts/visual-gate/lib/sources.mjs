 * Both come from the same places the product does — `collectThemingTargets`
 * is the CLI's own enumeration (the one `astryx theme targets` prints and
 * `astryx theme build` validates against), and theme overrides are read out of

 * here is a second registry: if the gate and the compiler ever disagree about
 * what is themeable, that is a bug in one shared function, not a drift between

 *
 * The probe theme is deliberately EXCLUDED. It styles every target by
 * construction, so feeding it to the theme matrix would ask for a shot per
 * (target x story that renders it) — 614 shots here — to answer a question the
 * probe tier answers in 128 with a set cover. It is a coverage instrument, not
 * a theme someone ships.
 *
 * Builds what it cannot read. On CI these dists arrive as an artifact from the
 * job that already built them, and three changes in one day to how that
 * artifact is named and filled each reddened the gate on every open component
 * PR with a missing-file error about something no PR had touched. The gate owns its own
 * prerequisites now, so how they get onto the runner is an optimisation rather

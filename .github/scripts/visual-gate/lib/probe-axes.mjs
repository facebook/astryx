/**
 * @file The other five theme axes, and the shape a probe needs for each.
 *
 * @input  the theme contract (`defineTheme`) and the registries it accepts
 * @output the non-`components` half of the probe theme, plus what each axis
 *         needs a story to render before it can be verified
 *
 * `defineTheme` takes six things. The generated component overrides cover one
 * of them, and until this file the other five had no coverage at all: a theme
 * could stop applying its icons, swap the wrong indicator, or lose a token,
 * and every test in the repo would still pass.
 *
 * They are not verifiable the same way, and pretending otherwise is how a
 * check ends up asserting nothing:
 *
 *   tokens      — a CSS custom property. Read it off the themed element and
 *                 compare; no component involvement, so this is exact.
 *   icons       — a component swap keyed by name. The proof is that the
 *                 REPLACEMENT rendered, so the probe swaps in a marked glyph
 *                 and the check looks for the marker.
 *   indicators  — the same, and the one Cindy named: `defineTheme({indicators})`
 *                 replaces the checkbox/radio/check visual everywhere at once.
 *                 A family-checked registry, so a `radio` replacement must
 *                 accept `singleSelection` states.
 *   fonts       — a font-family string; exact, same as a token.
 *   syntax      — a code-token colour map; exact per token, but only renders
 *                 inside a CodeBlock, so it needs a story that has one.
 *
 * Each probe value is deliberately absurd and unique, for the same reason the
 * component overrides are: the question is "did this arrive", not "does this
 * look right", and a value nothing else in the system would produce cannot
 * pass by coincidence.
